Hi

If you notify error into the prefabs, send me an email to black.creepy.cat@gmail.com

Sometime when you import the package, unity to dot make correctly the link between 
materials and prefabs! Do not panic send me an email and i will make the correction 
soon as possible :)

If you want to make the modifications by yourself, you just have to re drop the material 
on the particle emitter under the prefab. Example :

Select the material into the desired pack folder "_Materials" select the material and drop
it into the prefab emitter into the folder _Prefabs.

Example if the prefab is called :

"Electric_01_8x8-64", unfold it and you will see :
Particle System
Point Light

Drop the material called "Electric_01_8x8-64" on "Particle System"

Thanks to bought the package :) Do not hesitate to put a review, it should 
really appreciated!

Regards
