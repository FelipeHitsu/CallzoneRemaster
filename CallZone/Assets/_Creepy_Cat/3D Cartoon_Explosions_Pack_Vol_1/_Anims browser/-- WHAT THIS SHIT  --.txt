Hi

This small tool is a browser for the spritesheet animations :) 

Launch the scene and you can browse all the package sprite 
animations. Ok i'm a bad coder, i do what i can... 

I just hope that help you, the code is usefull for noobs that want
to explore how to instanciate stuff or others :)

Regards
